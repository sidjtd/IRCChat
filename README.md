# IRC Chat

This project is simulates an IRC server by creating a server and client, and allowing them to talk to each other by opening up sockets with node.

**Installation**
```
  Clone this repo

  Navigate into this directory

  sudo npm install

  open up two terminals, one for the server and one for the client.

  Run the server.js first using node, then run the client.js.

  To simulate multiple users, just open up another terminal and run another client.js

  People on your local network can also connect to it, if you change the hostname to your own.
```
